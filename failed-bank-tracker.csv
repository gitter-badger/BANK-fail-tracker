The central bank and a group of Danish financial companies will provide Roskilde 4.5 billion kroner ($890 million) in cash and assume 37.3 billion kroner of debt, Roskilde said in a statement yesterday. The bank was suspended in Copenhagen trading today, after falling 88 percent from a peak in April 2007. ``We wanted to secure financial stability in Denmark,'' central bank Governor Nils Bernstein said at a press conference in Copenhagen today. ``The alternative would have been that Roskilde went bankrupt and that would have resulted in a considerable contagion throughout the financial sector.'' Writedowns on real estate loans led to a pretax loss of at least 1 billion kroner in the first half, double an estimate the bank published on July 14, Roskilde said yesterday. Denmark entered a recession in the first quarter, the first European economy to do so since the global credit crisis began last year. The bailout is the first by the Danish central bank in 15 years.

Germany’s bank rescue fund, Soffin, which already owned more than 47 percent of Munich-based Hypo Real Estate, will inject 2.96 billion euros ($4.2 billion) to take full control, the company said in an e-mailed statement. Investors approved the plan at an extraordinary meeting yesterday. Hypo Real Estate almost collapsed in September after its Dublin-based Depfa Bank Plc unit couldn’t raise short-term funds amid the credit crisis. The company needed 102 billion euros of credit lines and debt guarantees from the government and the country’s financial institutions, and will require more aid even after the capital infusion approved yesterday. While the capital increase “is a vital part of the whole recapitalization of the company, it’s not sufficient,” Chief Executive Officer Axel Wieandt told shareholders at the meeting in Munich yesterday. He didn’t estimate the amount required. The plan to nationalize Hypo Real Estate has been opposed by investors including New York-based buyout firm J.C.

2009-09-28,"Italy's Banco Popolare became the first Italian bank to subscribe to the government's $15.3 billion bailout program on Monday. Other banks are likely to follow suit, highlighting how the problems within the global banking sector have spread rapidly even to those that had steered clear of U.S. subprime investments. Banco Popolare, based in Verona, said it would be selling 1.5 billion euros ($1.9 billion) of convertible bonds to the government, paying an annual yield of between 7.5% to 8.5% for the first few years.

2008-11-08,"The Latvian government is set to increase its stake in Parex Banka, the country’s second largest bank, to 84 per cent in order to reassure depositors, creditors and the International Monetary Fund. The agreement, reached late on Tuesday, nationalises the last big independent Baltic bank, taking the state’s stake up from 51 per cent, and marks the collapse of the empire of Valery Kargin and Viktor Krasovitsky, once Latvia’s richest men. Mr Kargin and Mr Krasovitsky, Russian Jews with good Communist party connections, won the first private licence in the Soviet Union to trade in hard currency in 1990. After Latvia achieved independence in 1991 they built a lucrative business servicing Russian capital flight. Parex survived three Latvian banking crises during the 1990s but it was powerless to withstand the impact of the credit crisis and the Baltic recession. Depositors lost confidence last month because it lacked a strong foreign parent, unlike Swedish-owned rivals. Servicing Russian capital flight proved a fatal weakness when non-resident clients – representing half its deposits – withdrew funds. Last month the founders handed a 51 per cent stake to the government but this was not enough to end the bank’s agonies.",,"Riga, Latvia","56.946, 24.114905",Financial Times,http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/d107ae4c-c190-11dd-831e-000077b07658.html#axzz2GqUo6Gzk,,,,Hipotēku banka (owned by Latvian government),Nationalisation,Latvia,,,

2011-11-23,"Lithuania's central bank said it would file a request on Friday for Snoras, the country's fifth largest bank, to be declared bankrupt because it was insolvent and had a bigger hole in reported assets than previously thought. Russian businessman Vladimir Antonov, who owned a majority stake in Snoras, and his Lithuanian partner Raimondas Baranauskas were detained on Thursday in London on a European arrest warrant. Prosecutors said they were suspected of large-scale embezzlement and fraud. Snoras owned 68 percent of Latvijas Krajbanka, which Latvia took over on Monday. ""I don't think there should be any problems in relations between Lithuania and Latvia because of one guy's, Mr. Antonov's, fraud in Lithuania and Latvia,"" Lithuania's Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius said. However, Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis canceled a planned visit to Lithuania on Friday, and held emergency talks on Krajbanka. He said that in a phone conversation with Kubilius he had ""expressed regret that Lithuania did not manage to stabilise Snoras. Clients in both countries will suffer."" Latvia's banking watchdog said it was pushing for Krajbanka, the country's oldest bank, to be declared bankrupt. There were some 100 million lats in assets missing from Krajbanka, according to the country's Financial and Capital Market Commission (FKTK).

2012-07-16,"The situation of Spain's troubled financial sector is well-documented; however, news of a Spanish bank being liquidated has virtually gone unnoticed by the international press. CAM, short for Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo, will officially enter a liquidation process following a general assembly meeting held last Monday. In reality, the entity's core banking business was acquired by Banco Sabadell, meaning that only remnants of the business, mostly social programs, are being liquidated. (Let's call it a partial liquidation of a Spanish 'caja'.) The main concern, however, is that bank customers are suffering losses as a result of the bank's failure, and that is something that should not be taken lightly. At CAM's general assembly meeting, members voted against the FROB's (Spain's Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring) proposal to amortize outstanding non-voting shares ('cuotas participativas') to zero, claiming that the move would be detrimental to thousands of customers.
