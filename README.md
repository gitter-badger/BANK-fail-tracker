Data fetching & munging of Failed Bank Tracker

## Source
The data is retrieved from  [the Open Economics project spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X35LxE2Vi7kYXlXkh_4TVnocq8AqTzdpCbaXoMjCB_8/edit#gid=0), which is community driven. 
The initial spreadsheet is not being updated for a while, but, fortunately for us, no banks have been accusing severe financial distress.
