The first to fail under Denmark’s new resolution rules was, of course, Amagerbanken, early this year. In that sense the failure of Fjordbank is more of the same. According to independent research firm CreditSights, Finansiel Stabilitet has given Fjordbank’s assets a preliminary valuation of DKK 7.8bn (€1bn) — which would cover about 74 per cent of senior liabilities. In other words, investors in the bank’s senior debt and the 450 or so deposit holders of Denmark’s €100,000 limit are looking at a haircut of about 26 per cent — somewhat lower than Amagerbanken’s 41 per cent.", "Image": "", "Place*": "Nykøbing Mors, Denmark", "Location (latitude, longitude)": "56.794521, 8.86307", "Source*": "Financial Times", "Source URL*": "http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2011/06/27/606556/another-danish-bank-falls-into-a-fjord-of-failure/", "Total assets of balance sheet of bank at time of failure (EUR + orig. currency)*": "", "Source (link for total asset of balance sheet)": "", "Corporate entity": "", "Acquirer (public or private)": "Finansiel Stabilitet (Danish national asset management agency)", "Type of restructuring": "Nationalisation", "Home country*": "Denmark", "Failed (Yes/No)": "", "Amount": "", "Did the bank receive state aid?": ""}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [10.390795, 55.39617]}, "properties": {"Date": "2009-02-23", "Description*": "Small Danish bank Fionia said on Monday it ceded control to the Danish state in return for a 1 billion Danish crown ($169 million) capital injection that keeps it solvent.

Germany’s bank rescue fund, Soffin, which already owned more than 47 percent of Munich-based Hypo Real Estate, will inject 2.96 billion euros ($4.2 billion) to take full control, the company said in an e-mailed statement. Investors approved the plan at an extraordinary meeting yesterday. Hypo Real Estate almost collapsed in September after its Dublin-based Depfa Bank Plc unit couldn’t raise short-term funds amid the credit crisis. The company needed 102 billion euros of credit lines and debt guarantees from the government and the country’s financial institutions, and will require more aid even after the capital infusion approved yesterday. While the capital increase “is a vital part of the whole recapitalization of the company, it’s not sufficient,” Chief Executive Officer Axel Wieandt told shareholders at the meeting in Munich yesterday. He didn’t estimate the amount required. The plan to nationalize Hypo Real Estate has been opposed by investors including New York-based buyout firm J.C. Flowers & Co., which bought a stake in the company last year for 22.50 euros a share.
