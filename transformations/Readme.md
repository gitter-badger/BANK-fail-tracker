## Transformations

Transform the csv file to a geojson file for easier mapping.

### Installation

This script needs to run as a bash script instead of a simple shell script.

Install `csvkit` with pip: `pip install csvkit`

### Run the transformation

Run `make` to create the geojson file.
Run `make clean` to clean the resulting data.
